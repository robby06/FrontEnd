Babel is a compiler. Its job is to translate ES6 syntax into the equivalent ES5 code to be run by a
browserâ€™s JavaScript engine

-Babel converts ES6 module syntax into the equivalent Node.js-style require and
module.exports syntax. Browserify then converts Node.js module code into ES5-friendly functions.
