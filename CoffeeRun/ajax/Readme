Notes
-Two useful properties are response and status, which are updated as soon as any changes
occur. The response property contains the data (such as HTML, XML, JSON, or another format)
sent back by the server. The status is a numeric code that tells you whether the HTTP response was
successful or not. These are officially known as HTTP Status Codes.
